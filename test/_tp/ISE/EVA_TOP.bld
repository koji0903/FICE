WARNING:ConstraintSystem - TNM : CLK60MHZ was distributed to a DCM but new TNM
   constraints were not derived. The requirement for derived TNM constraints is
   that the distributed TNM is referenced by no more than a single PERIOD
   constraint. Non-PERIOD referencers are also not allowed. This TNM is used in
   the following user groups or specifications:
   <TIMEGRP "CLK60MHZ_grp" = "CLK60MHZ" EXCEPT "FCLK" "USBCLK" "ICEWR" "OCDCLK"
   "FMAIN_PCLBUZ" "FSUB_PCLBUZ" "FMX4";> [EVA_TOP_10MHz.ucf(59)]

WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMEGRP

   "chiptop_chip_socket_csc_cg_tbase_FCLK_ICE";> [EVA_TOP_10MHz.ucf(785)] is

   overriden constraint usually comes from the input netlist or ncf files.
